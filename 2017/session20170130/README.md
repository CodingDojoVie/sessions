## Coding Dojo Vienna, Session 20170130 ##

Specific topic and special guest facilitator from Linz, David Tanzer!

In this dojo, we will try to understand, test, and refactor a pretty bad piece of code. We will all work on the same piece of Java code.
Even if you are not working with Java on a day-to-day basis, practising on it will help with the object-oriented code of your profession.
