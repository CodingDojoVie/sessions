## Coding Dojo Vienna, Session 20190129 ##

In the January Coding Dojo we will work a brand new exercise: practice breaking dependencies in legacy code to create tests for it.

We have some legacy code and we need to make changes. To make changes we need to introduce tests first. We might have to change some code to enable testing. We will introduce so-called Seams (see Michael Feathers' Working Effectively with Legacy Code). The Dojo will focus on techniques how to introduce Seams and then add tests.

Moderator: Roland Germ and Peter 'Code Cop' Kofler
