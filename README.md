# Coding Dojo Vienna - Sessions

This repository contains the presentations for the coding dojo session. The presentations can come in various formats, depending on the moderator that held the sessions.

## Preparing and Hosting a Dojo
### Prepare the Session
Choose a topic or theme and prepare a presentation. Optionally also prepare a Handout and some Code to work on.

## Preparing a Presentation with reveal.js

Several presentations are based on [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/), which is also contained in the repository. These presentations are simple enough and can be opened by a browser locally. (A Node.js/Grunt.js based setup is also provided, but hardly necessary)


#### Presentation Structure and Introduction
Try to follow the existing structure of the presentations, at least the introduction:

**The introduction should contain:**
* Reference to "Coding Dojo Vienna"
* Twitter hash tag ```#CodingDojoVie```
* Hint about next session (if available)

**Also consider mentioning:**
* What is a Dojo?
* What are the rules?
* Why do we do deliberate practise?

Think about a break in between and Retrospectives.

### Adding a New Session in this repository
Simply add a new folder ```sessionYYYYMMDD``` with the date properly filled in. 

### Find a location and a fitting Date and time
* When picking a date discuss the suggistion with the other facilitaters to avoid conflicting community events **before** announcing the event to anyone
* Provide a room for up to 20 people 
* Ensure enough power supplies for their Laptops
* Consider providing some snacks.
* Think about how they can access the location (security etc.)
* default time is 17:45-20:00

### Create a doodle appointment
* Only 1 date and time
* Limit to 20 people or less
