# Coding Dojo Vienna - Sessions

This repository contains the presentations for the coding dojo session. The presentations can come in various formats, depending on the moderator that held the sessions.

## Made with reveal.js

Several presentations are based on [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/), which is also contained in the repository.

These presentations are simple enough and can be opened by a browser locally. (A Node.js/Grunt.js based setup is also provided, but hardly necessary)

## Adding a New Session
Simply add a new folder ```sessionYYYYMMDD``` with the date properly filled in. Try to follow the existing structure of the presentations, at least the introduction:

### Introduction
The introduction should contain
* Reference to "Coding Dojo Vienna"
* Twitter hash tag #CodingDojoVie
* Hint about next session (if available)
